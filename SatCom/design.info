Sources
----------
Sources are defined as systems to provide data for transmission over satellite network.

Interface Module
----------
Interface modules provide a means for SRCs and the SD-SIGBUS to communicate proper throughput rates and synchronize sending/receiving between SRCs and SD-SIGBUS.

In any state in which an ITFC-MOD is capable of sending, it must also be capable of receiving and responding to signals passed by the SD-SIGBUS.

A number of signals must be received and handled properly by ITFC-MOD:
 - START signal; begins the transmission of data from SRC to SD-SIGBUS
 - CEASE signal; cease transmission of data from SRC to SD-SIGBUS - countermands START
 - CALL signal; calls for new frame of data to be sent

Additional signals may be passed through ITFC-MODs to their respective SRCs as determined by each SRC.

ITFC-MOD is permitted to transmit to SD-SIGBUS only if a START signal has been provided which has not been countermanded by a CEASE signal originating from SD-SIGBUS.
As data may be generated by SRC at a higher rate than that requested by SD-SIGBUS, ITFC-MOD is responsible for resampling, re-encoding, buffering, or other external means of handling data provided by SRC.

Satellite Communications Module
----------
The Satellite Communications Module provides an interface with an onboard Rockblock to handle packet- packing/unpacking and relaying of signals
in a reliable and tolerant manner.

Software-defined Signal Bus
----------
The Software-defined Signal Bus is responsible for sending processed datagraams from ITFC-MODs to SATCOM-MOD and control commands from SATCOM-MOD to addressable ITFC-MODs.

Protocols
--------------------
1.1 ITFC-MOD START
----------

i.  ITFC-MOD is required to fail-to-transmit to SD-SIGBUS until a startup signal is provided.  Immediately after startup, ITFC-MOD solicits coverage by SD-SIGBUS via a datagram of format:
    |53 54 52 54 <ID-32> <NONCE-32> <BITLENGTH-64>|
The NONCE field is a 32-bit sequence to provide recognition of packet uniqueness.  If no NONCE is operationally required, it may be set to a random 32-bit sequence.
The ID field is a 32-bit sequence used to identify a particular entity acting over the channel versus any other.
The BITLENGTH field is a 64-bit unsigned integer representing the number of transmitted bits ITFC-MOD intends to send to SD-SIGBUS.

ITFC-MOD may choose to, until responded to by SD-SIGBUS, retransmit given that ITFC-MOD is capable of receiving, and appropriately responding to response by SD-SIGBUS.  The packet NONCE is permitted to change between transmissions although SD-SIGBUS does not guarantee that the last transmitted NONCE will be used in reply.  The ID field is required to be unvarying throughout the lifetime of the session (until CEASE).

ii. SD-SIGBUS is required to respond once available to do so.  It may yield:
    |41 43 4B 20 <NONCE-32> <ID-32> <PERIODICITY-32> <BITLENGTH-64> <FLUSH-8>|

The NONCE field will be an echo of the first received datagram.  All future datagrams from that particular ID soliciting session startup will be disregarded until data has begun transmission.
The PERIODICITY field is a 32-bit float dictating the estimated periodicity of data queries.  SD-SIGBUS does not enforce the exact periodicity of data queries.
The responded BITLENGTH in the response is not guaranteed to match the received request.  For the remainder of the session, only the first BITLENGTH bits will be read from datagrams, the remainder disposed.

After completion of ii., SD-SIGBUS will retain memory of entity <ID-32> for future response-transmission.

1.2 ITFC-MOD CALL
----------

i.  SD-SIGBUS will call for transmission from ITFC-MOD in the format
    |43 41 4C 4C|

ii. ITFC-MOD is now cleared to transmit data of length <BITLENGTH-64> (refer to 1.1.ii) in format
    |52 45 53 50 <MSG-BITLENGTH>|
    From MSG, exactly BITLENGTH bits will be read, the rest discarded.

1.3 ITFC-MOD CEASE
----------

i.  The CEASE signal will inform ITFC-MOD that it will no longer read transmission data from the buffer.  The packet will be of format
    |43 45 53 45|

ii. To resume transmission, ITFC-MOD is permitted to re-solicit coverage (refer to 1.1).
