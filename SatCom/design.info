(01) Accept data over various listeners
(02) Format data into packets
(03) Transmit packets

--- (01) ---
Receives data over wire in separated processes/threads
1 Process per type (I2C, UART, SPI) with multiple threads for multiple streams (e.g. I2C 1 and I2C 2)

--- (02) ---
Accepts data from shared processes/threading and formats into subpacket

--- (03) ---
Compress packet and push to buffer/-queue

--- (NOTES) ---
Multiple connections can be made to the Raspberry Pi (I2C 2x, UART 1x, SPI 2x) allowing for potentially 5 sources to directly interface with the Raspberry Pi

RPI-Arduino I2C: (apparently slow)

RPI-Arduino SPI: (preferred)

RPI-Arduino UART: (best unidirectional)
